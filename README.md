In Java, you can't directly confirm the removal of values from specific objects after garbage collection. The garbage collector's primary role is to reclaim memory from objects that are no longer reachable, and it doesn't expose information about the specific objects it has collected.

However, you can indirectly observe the effects of garbage collection by monitoring memory usage or using profiling tools. If objects have been successfully garbage collected, you should see a decrease in the memory usage of your program.

This example calculates and prints the memory usage before and after garbage collection. If garbage collection is successful, you should see a decrease in memory usage.

Keep in mind that garbage collection behavior can vary across different JVMs and configurations, and relying on specific details about which objects are collected is not part of the usual Java programming model.
